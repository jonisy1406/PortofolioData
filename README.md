## About The Projects 

These projects were created while taking part in a data science bootcamp series at Rakamin Academy and a virtual internship at ID/X Partners. The tools used are as follows:  
* Python : used for exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning.
* SQL (PostgreSQL): used to create databases from csv files and perform queries on PostgreSQL.
* Excel : used to perform simple visualizations.
