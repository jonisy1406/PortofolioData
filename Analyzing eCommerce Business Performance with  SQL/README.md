# Analyzing eCommerce Business Performance with SQL
In a company, measuring business performance is very important to track, monitor, and assess the success or failure of various business processes." Therefore, this time a business performance analysis will be carried out for an eCommerce company, taking into account several business metrics, namely customer growth, product quality, and payment type.  

To conduct an analysis, this project was carried out in several steps:
1. Data Preparation  
Before starting data processing, the earliest stage is to prepare the raw data into structured and ready-to-process data. As a result, all data sets in.csv format are imported into the database during the data preparation stage using the following procedure (Create Workspace, Importing Data, Build Entity Relationship).
2. Do a query based on the specified metric.
At this stage several queries are carried out to retrieve data from the database. Some of the things analyzed in this project are as follows:  
>* Annual Customer Activity Growth Analysis
