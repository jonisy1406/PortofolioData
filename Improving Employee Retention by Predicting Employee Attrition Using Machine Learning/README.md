# Improving Employee Retention by Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning

## Background
Human resources (HR) are the main assets that need to be managed properly by a company so that business goals can be achieved effectively and efficiently. On this occasion, we will face a problem regarding human resources in the company. Our focus is to find out how to keep employees afloat in an existing company, which can result in increased costs for employee recruitment and training for those who have just entered.

Many employees have resigned from the company (31%).    

### Goal  
* Reducing the rate of resignation from the company.   
* Increase the retention of employees.    

### Objective
* Create a machine learning model that can predict employees who resign.  
* Provide business recommendations based on the model that has been built.    

### Business Metric
Rate of resignation
